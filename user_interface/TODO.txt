Things to TODO:

Urgent and important
========
-integrate enriques validation back in
	-selectItem -> checkout, shouldn't be able to proceed without specifying sizes. this may involve getting validation back
-settings and home buttons don't work anymore?
-Dynamically load in choose restaurants field on `restaurant_select` and `home_screen`
-What is up with the rate calculation - why is a burrito $25.00 haha
-Add more Data
  -Add more restaurants and even more realistic menus and prices
  -Also accordingly update the search.json so we can have at least some searches that noticebly filter down the number of restaurants we choose from.



Not Urgent, but important
=========
-Add in see 'past order history' feature
-Using location and Google Distance API for distance of restaurants
    -Get geolocation coordinates of the restaurants
-Live rate changing feature in the JS
  -this will involve adding rate checking features in at every step of purchase
-Move compilation of templates to a one-time initial page load function. Because we don't need to recompile each time a new screen is loaded, just only the render step is needed. This will ensure better performance
-pressing enter on search bar shouldn't completely break, and form submit to some new page (or whatever is going on)
